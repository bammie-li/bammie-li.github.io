"Gosh, I wonder if I am even in the right building or I am going to end up late in all of my classes!" Mary exclaims and sighed. There are a few students in the hallways but she's too scared to approach any of them.<br><br>"Are you the new student in Magic Academy?" Mary felt someone touch her shoulder and she turns around and saw two fairies, one blonde and one with purple hair. Mary nods and nervously laughs. "We can help you find you classes!" The blonde fairy says smiling, "Can I see your schedule?"<br><br>"Of course!" Mary hands the fairy her schedule, "My name is Mary by the way."<br><br>"Oh goodness, We forgot to introduce ourselves, my name is Gladiolus and her name is Freesia." The purple fairy says while looking at the schedule that Freesia is holding. Mary is glad to be able to make friends on her first day and to be able to put names on her friends. She hopes that they have classes together so she does not feel lonely in lecture.<br><br>"I have a couple classes with you and one of them is before lunch. Do you want to have lunch with us?" Freesia asks, handing the schedule back to Mary.<br><br>Should Mary join them for lunch? </font><br><br><font color="white"> | <a href="index.html">Beginning</a><font color="white"> | <a href="first_lunch.html">Join Them</a><font color="white"> | <a href="second_day.html">Next Day</a><font color="white"> | </p></div></div>
